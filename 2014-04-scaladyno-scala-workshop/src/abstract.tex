\section{Abstract}

In the academic and the professional community it is agreed on the fact that
both statically and dynamically typed languages have both benefits and
drawbacks. Statically typed languages provide important feedback at compile time
about parts of the program which will go wrong at runtime and thus won't even
compile. However this kind of type system is also quite strict and thus very
unflexible to the developer.
Dynamically typed languages on the other hand give a lot more freedom to the
developer due to the loose type system where most checks are done at runtime and
the class structures are extensible. It would thus sometimes be useful to have a
programming language with have a blend of the two kinds of languages with most
the benefits combined. Such a language would allow fast prototyping and could as
well provide static guarantees when needed.
ScalaDyno is a take on such a language where the current Scala compiler is
extended such that it deferres naming and typing errors to runtime. This paper
should show the use cases
