\section{Abstract}

In the academic and the professional community it is agreed on the fact that both statically and dynamically typed languages have both benefits and drawbacks. Statically typed languages will reject any code that they cannot prove to be correct. However this is very inflexible to the developer when they are prototyping incompatible changes to the code.
Dynamically typed languages on the other hand give a lot more freedom to the developer by only performing the necessary checks at runtime.

It would be useful to have a programming language that combines the benefits of both static and dynamic typing. Such a language would allow agile development while also offering static guarantees for the final compilation.

The ScalaDyno compiler plugin allows fast prototyping with the Scala programming language. This in done by deferring compilation errors to runtime and thus allowing byte code generation for partially incorrect programs.
