\section{Theory}

In Scala type {\ttfamily Nothing} is a subtype of anything and can thus substitute the return value of any type in a method return value for example.
Similarly the error type is the same than type {\ttfamily Nothing} with some bit-flags set hence it can basically replace any value, be it a field, return value or argument. This property is needed for our solution not to break the type checker.
Another important feature of bug reporting
Moreover do many typing errors depend on earlier errors in the code such as manipulations of an instance which could not be created in the first place. Those spurious error messages should not be considered as entirely different errors but should all relate to the first error. There are many advanced techniques nowadays to eliminate those "spurious" error messages. As cited in Ramsey's [reference] paper, error messages related to an erroneous identifier should be identified by having the corresponding identifier in the symbol type and by suppressing all following errors. This method helps to catch the errors, to issue only the most relevant error message and identify the root cause of a specific error.
