% At this point I wanted to thank Vlad Ureche, my supervisor, for his great help with my semester project! By taking time off in his busy schedule, we were able to have weekly meetings where he gave me very valuable feedback without which this project would not have been successful. He also did large parts of the writing of this paper and helped me with the implementation.
