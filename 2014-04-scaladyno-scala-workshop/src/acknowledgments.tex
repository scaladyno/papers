 \section{Acknowledgments}

% Vlad: I am an author, which is more than a acknowledgement
%  At this point I wanted to thank Vlad Ureche, my supervisor, for his great help with this semester project. By taking time off in his busy schedule, we were able to have weekly meetings where he gave me very valuable feedback without which this project would not have been successful.

The authors would like to thank Damien Engels for his help with setting up the infrastructure, the reviewers who read the initial draft of the paper and gave us useful feedback and the members of the Programming Languages Laboratory in EPFL with whom we had very frutiful discussions on the fundamentals of avoiding type checking errors (and especially to Hubert Plociniczak, Eugene Burmako and Sandro Stucki). \\
