\section{Conclusion}
% We have tested our solution on a varied set of examples where we achieved good results! We did not yet deploy the compiler plugin for a large scale project, neither did we do a field study where we could have asked a group of developers to use the tool for some time. The limited testing is mostly due to the fact the described plugin has been realized as a small semester project with very strict timing constraints.

Deferring type errors are a very important feature which enables quick prototyping and development. Most implementations that allow fast prototyping fall short of the goals of optional type checking, maximum performance for correct code and applicability for the Scala language. The prototype we have presented shows promising results with a small development investment of only 200 lines of code.

% The implementation of the ScalaDyno compiler is open source and publicly available on github (https://github.com/scaladyno) as well as related information such as the documentation, a setup guide and a repository containing a set of examples.
