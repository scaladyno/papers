\section{Conclusion}
We have tested our solution on a varied set of examples where we achieved good results! However did we not yet deploy the modified compiler for a large scale project, also did we not do a field study where we could have asked a group of developers to use the tools over a specific time period. The limited testing is mostly due to the fact the The described plugin has been realized as a small semester project and with very strict timing constraints.
Even though fully dynamic languages have some other features like duck typing and monkey patching, deferring type errors play also a very important part which we considered important enough to be implemented on its own. Some other implementations to make Scala more dynamic have already been made, as described in the related work section, but most of those approaches require additional runtime support which increases the overhead and potentially makes compiling and running the programs slower. The quick and easy realized we presented also shows that some dynamic features can be implemented quite easily with lightweight implementations which might be interesting for further development.

The implementation of the ScalaDyno compiler is open source and publicly available on github (https://github.com/scaladyno) as well as related information such as the documentation, a setup guide and a repository containing a set of examples.
