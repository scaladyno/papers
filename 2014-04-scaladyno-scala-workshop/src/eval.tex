\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate the plugin we compiled scalaz \cite{scalaz}, a well known type class library in Scala. To test the functionality, we commented out class |CobindOps|. We received 4 warnings but the compilation succeeded and we were able to execute some of the scalaz-tests. This transformation does however not work for all the cases due to an incomplete tree cleanup and the fact that parsing and overriding errors can still prevent the code from being compiled all the way.
